# VR-Prototype-Construction

This project is a virtual reality (VR) prototype for a construction simulation game created using Unity. The main objective of the game is to maneuver a large excavator within a construction site and achieve specific goals without colliding with other elements.

## Game Description

In this game, the player operates a large excavator at a construction site. The goal is to move the excavator to the center of a white banner that appears in the game. The game is won when the excavator is positioned in the middle of this area. If the excavator collides with any other elements in the environment, the game is over.

## Features

- **Realistic Excavator Control:** Experience controlling a large excavator with realistic physics and movements.
- **Winning Condition:** Navigate the excavator to the center of the white banner to win the game.
- **Game Over Condition:** Avoid colliding with other elements in the construction site to prevent the game from ending.
- **Immersive VR Environment:** Fully immersive virtual reality environment to enhance the gameplay experience.
